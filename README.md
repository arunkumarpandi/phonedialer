# phonedialer

The app that you are going to design is a phone dialer which we can use to make calls.The dialer should be connected to a particular sim number available in the phone and all the calls made by that dialer or that particular sim should be recorded and logs need to be created.The data needs to be stored and internally and the data should be backed to a cloud database periodically or when wifi / network is detected.
